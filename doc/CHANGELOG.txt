22-07-2024 - The initial preliminary version of the code.

07-04-2025 - The first release of the code (version 1.0).
             The code of the numerical experiment has been modified to
             accommodate the new face orientation scheme of the FE_Nedelec
             finite elements of deal.II. The static logbook has been modified
             accordingly. No new numerical experiments has been added. The code
             should work with the versions of deal.II that were released after
             29.01.2025, i.e., deal.II-9.7.0 and newer versions.
